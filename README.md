## The Problem

The traditional hiring process is broken. Job seekers write generic cover letters. Hiring managers can't tell who actually cares about the role. Great candidates get overlooked while better self-promoters move forward.

PreFace replaces the cover letter with something that actually matters. Learning.

## How It Works

Instead of asking candidates to tell us they're interested, we show them what the role entails and let them prove it by learning.

Candidates take interactive, role-specific courses about the company, position, and industry. They earn certificates upon completion. Employers see concrete evidence of how well someone understands the role and aligns with company values.

Candidates learn something valuable even if they don't get the job. Employers get real insight into who their applicants are.

## Why It Works

Traditional applications ask candidates to claim they're a good fit. PreFace asks them to show it.

We replace empty claims with real evidence. Employers see how candidates think and learn, not just how they write. Structured assessments focus on skills and alignment rather than resume formatting. Completing a course takes effort and filters for genuine motivation.
