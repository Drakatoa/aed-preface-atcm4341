# PreFace - Redesigning the Hiring & Onboarding Experience

**ATCM 4341 - Applied Experience Design | Design Capstone Project**  
**Partner:** Fisher Investments

## Project Overview

PreFace is a design intervention that reimagines the hiring and onboarding experience for financial services companies. Developed in partnership with Fisher Investments, this project addresses two critical challenges in the recruitment process:

1. **Helping employers identify the right candidates** - Providing HR teams with better assessment tools and candidate insights
2. **Reducing candidate apathy** - Transforming the traditional cover letter into an engaging, skill-building experience that demonstrates genuine interest

Instead of asking candidates to write generic cover letters, PreFace guides them through interactive, role-specific courses that teach them about the company, role requirements, and industry knowledge. Candidates earn certificates upon completion, which employers can review to assess both technical proficiency and cultural fit.
